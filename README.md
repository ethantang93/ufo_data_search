# ufo_data_search
This is the source code to the client-side search engine at [ufo-search.com](https://www.ufo-search.com/timeline/search.html).

It relies on source data compiled by the [ufo_data](https://github.com/richgel999/ufo_data) tool.

TODO: This release is a work in progress. I'll provide actual build documentation and clean up build scripts soon-ish.
